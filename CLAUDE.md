# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized Git repository with minimal setup. The repository currently contains only configuration files:

- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code settings with git warning suppression

## Project State

This appears to be a fresh "aiops" project that has been initialized but does not yet contain any source code, build configurations, or documentation. Future development work will need to establish:

- Project structure and programming language(s)
- Build system and dependency management
- Testing framework
- Development workflow

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, there are currently no build, test, or development commands available. Once the project structure is established, this file should be updated with the relevant commands for:

- Installing dependencies
- Running the application
- Building for production
- Running tests
- Linting and formatting

## Notes for Future Development

When working in this repository, consider establishing conventions for:
- Code organization and module structure
- Testing patterns and coverage requirements
- Documentation standards
- Deployment procedures
